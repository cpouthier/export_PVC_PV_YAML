# Blueprint: pvc-pv-manifest-export-restore

This Kanister blueprint enables the **backup and restoration of PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** and **PersistentVolume (PV)** manifests via ConfigMaps. It is designed to work with Veeam Kasten and can be used to preserve Kubernetes storage object definitions during application backup and restore operations.

**WARNING**

The provided blueprint **is not supported by the editor and is supplied as-is**. Functionality, compatibility, and correctness are not guaranteed. Please verify and adjust as needed before use.

## üß© Use Case

This blueprint is intended for scenarios where:
- You need to retain or migrate PVC/PV manifests during a Kasten K10 snapshot-based backup.
- You use dynamic storage classes and want to preserve/restore claims manually.
- Your storage class does not support snapshots and you backup it in another way.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Actions defined in the blueprint

### `preSnapshot`

Executed before a backup, this action:
- Selects PVCs using a label defined in a ConfigMap (`sc-label`) located in the `kasten-io` namespace.
- Exports all matching PVC and PV manifests in the application namespace.
- Sanitizes the manifests (removes metadata such as UIDs, timestamps, managedFields, etc.).
- Stores them in a new ConfigMap named `cm-pvc-pv` in the application namespace.

### `postRestore`

Executed after a successful restore, this action:
- Retrieves the `cm-pvc-pv` ConfigMap.
- Extracts and re-applies all previously saved PVC and PV manifests.
- Deletes the ConfigMap after rehydration to avoid future conflicts.

## üß± Requirements

- Kubernetes 1.21+
- Access to Image : [`cpouthier/blueprint:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/r/cpouthier/blueprint)
  > Includes `bash`, `kubectl`, `jq`, and `yq`

  > You can also create your own image using https://github.com/cpouthier/light_docker_image_tools
- The storage class to include is (are) identified using a label defined in a ConfigMap in kasten-io namespace. In the example below we labelled the storage class with "zfs=true" and created the corresponding ConfigMap:

```console
kubectl label storageclass <your-storage-class-name> zfs=true
```

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: sc-label
     namespace: kasten-io
   data:
     storageClassLabel: "zfs=true"
   ```
   **Remember that you'll need to exclude from the bakcup policy PVCs belonging to this storage class.**

2. **Export logic**:
   - Extract PVC/PV YAMLs to a temporary directory.
   - Sanitize each manifest using `yq`.
   - Store all cleaned YAMLs as files in a ConfigMap.

3. **Restore logic**:
   - Decode ConfigMap content back into YAML files.
   - Reapply them in order (PVs first, then PVCs).
   - After restore, the blueprint automatically deletes the intermediate ConfigMap (`cm-pvc-pv`) into the application namespace.

## üîÅ How to use this blueprint (example)

In the example below we assume you have an NFS storage class exporting on 127.0.0.1

1. **Create a basic application deployment**:

Create the NFS persistent volume:

```console
Create PV
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: nfs-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: nfs
  mountOptions:
    - hard
    - nfsvers=4.1
  nfs:
    path: /data/nfs
    server: 127.0.0.1
EOF
```

Create the "test-data" namespace:

```console
kubectl create namespace test-data --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```
